# Our Security Policy

***** This is an incomplete draft and should not be used as is at this point.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| x.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| x.x.x   | :x:                |
| x.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Reporting your Findings
As always when it comes to bug bounty hunting, read the program's policy thoroughly. 
Very rarely does a program accept reports through GitHub. Contact the security team, the org open source team, or if possible use a 
bug bounty platform such as HackerOne or Bugcrowd. More research and a decision to be made on how the community can safely and 
privately report vulnerabilities.
